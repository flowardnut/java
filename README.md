Working through examples in a java book. Really just want to do the questions that intrigue me.

  * Banner -- models the old banner command (the non-BSD version). Note:only added a few letters.

  *   I'd rather letters be an array of Strings, and not just 7 hardcoded strings. This way we could dynamically tell the height, etc
  *
